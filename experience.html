        <h2>Wordpress</h2>
        <p>I used Wordpress in Cambodia to create a platform where people could get information about sexual health
            services as my friend, via USAID, had funded some services to help people but not managed to promote the
            much needed help to the people that actually needed it.</p>
        <P>And these services were desperately needed.</P>
        <p>Wordpress allowed me to easily manage the website and I also learnt a great deal about <strong>SEO</strong> as well as 
            publishing the site online.</p>

      <h2>Creating my own template</h2>
      <p>Although I had a website up and running for the USAID STD clinic, nobody visited it. To solve this problem
         I decided to take photographs of people out and about on the club scene, upload their pics to the site,
         and encourage them to view the site and tell their friends.</p><p>The site then became popular with reviews 
        about the club and bar scene in Cambodia that also included a page on Sexual Health Services. Suddenly it was 
        successful. To achieve this, I had had to learn how to change the template by using <strong>CSS, HTML</strong> 
        and a small amount of <strong>JAVASCRIPT</strong> to create a unique website for all the information that was 
        needed.</p>
